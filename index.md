## What is Black-Scholes model?

The Black-Scholes  or Black-Scholes-Merton model is a mathematical model of a financial market containing certain derivative investment instruments. From the model, one can deduce the Black-Scholes formula, which gives a theoretical estimate of the price of European-style options. The formula led to a boom in options trading and legitimised scientifically the activities of the Chicago Board Options Exchange and other options markets around the world. lt is widely used, although often with adjustments and corrections, by options market participants.Many empirical tests have shown that the Black-Scholes price is "fairly close" to the observed prices, although there are well-known discrepancies such as the "option smile"
